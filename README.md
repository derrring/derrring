# Hello! 

A mathematician fascinated by the dynamics of strategic decision-making in large populations.

## My Research: Mean Field Games

My research is centered on **Mean Field Games (MFG)**, a field that elegantly combines insights from three powerful areas of mathematics:
* **Stochastic Control:** Modeling individual decision-making under uncertainty.
* **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):** Describing the evolution of the entire population.
* **Game Theory:** Analyzing the strategic interactions between agents.

Essentially, I build and analyze models that explain how the micro-level actions of countless individuals give rise to macro-level phenomena.
