#  Hello! 

A mathematician fascinated by the dynamics of strategic decision-making in large populations, both from a technical and a humanist perspective.


##  My Research: Mean Field Games

$$
\begin{dcases}
    &-\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \nu\Delta u + H(x,m(t,x),\nabla u(t,x)) = 0 && \text{ in } [0,T)\times\mathcal{X} \\
    &\frac{\partial m}{\partial t} - \nu\Delta m - \mathrm{div}\left[m(t,\cdot)\partial_p H(\cdot,m(t,\cdot),\nabla u(t,\cdot)) \right] = 0 && \text{ in } (0,T]\times\mathcal{X} \\
    &u(T,x) = G(x,m(T,x)), \quad m(0,x) = m_0(x) && \text{ in }\mathcal{X} 
\end{dcases}
$$

My work is centered on **Mean Field Games (MFG)**, a field that combines insights from:
* **Stochastic Control:** Modeling individual decision-making under uncertainty.
* **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):** Describing the evolution of the whole population.
* **Game Theory:** Analyzing strategic interactions between agents.

##  The Humanist Connection

I believe mathematics can be a powerful lens for exploring classical questions in ethics. I draw inspiration from **philosophy** to ask how we can design systems that promote collective well-being.

My current side project, in collaboration with philosophers, is to **adapt extended utilitarianism into mean field game frameworks**. The goal is to build models that can explore the consequences of different ethical assumptions on a societal scale.
