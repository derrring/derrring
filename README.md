# 👋 Hello! 

A mathematician fascinated by the dynamics of strategic decision-making in large populations, both from a technical and a humanist perspective.


## 🔭 My Research: Mean Field Games

My work is centered on **Mean Field Games (MFG)**, a field that combines insights from:
* **Stochastic Control:** Modeling individual decision-making under uncertainty.
* **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):** Describing the evolution of the whole population.
* **Game Theory:** Analyzing strategic interactions between agents.

## 🏛️ The Humanist Connection

I believe mathematics can be a powerful lens for exploring classical questions in ethics. I draw inspiration from **ancient philosophy** to ask how we can design systems that promote collective well-being.

My current side project, in collaboration with philosophers, is to **adapt extended utilitarianism into mean field game frameworks**. The goal is to build models that can explore the consequences of different ethical assumptions on a societal scale.
